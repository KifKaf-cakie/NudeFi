# NudeFi: Decentralized Adult Content Platform

NudeFi is a decentralized platform for adult content creators built on Base chain. We leverage Zora's Coins Protocol to create a unique ecosystem where creators can tokenize their content as NFTs and build sustainable communities around their creator coins.

## üöÄ Features

### For Creators
- Mint adult content (images, videos, audio) as NFTs on Base chain
- Automatic ERC-20 token (Zora Coins) generation for each creator
- Multiple revenue streams: primary sales, secondary trading, and token trading fees
- AI-powered trend prediction and content optimization suggestions

### For Fans & Collectors
- Purchase NFTs to unlock exclusive content
- Trade creator coins for potential investment returns
- Access subscription-only content through coin holdings
- Participate in creator governance and decisions

### Platform Highlights
- Age verification and content moderation
- Privacy-focused decentralized storage
- Community governance through creator coins
- AI-powered content analytics and recommendations

## üí° How It Works

NudeFi integrates with Zora's Coins Protocol to enable a new economic model for adult content:

1. **Creator Registration**: Creators sign up and set up their profile
2. **Content Minting**: Creators upload content which is minted as NFTs
3. **Coin Creation**: Each creator automatically gets an ERC-20 token on first upload
4. **Community Building**: Fans buy creator coins to access premium features
5. **Trading & Economics**: Creator coins can be traded, with creators earning from trading fees
